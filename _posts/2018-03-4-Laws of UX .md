根据这个很Fancy的网站[Home | Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com)整理的UX规则。 

规则这东西每次都要想蛮累的。 

自己不负责任的翻译了一点中文，为了自己看起来方便。看到解释多的，就是我不够理解，然后从其他网站上复制黏贴过来的更详尽的解释。。因为很懒，就不翻译。 看两眼应该就能明白。 


[The Psychology Principles Every UI/UX Designer Needs to Know - Marvel Blog](https://blog.marvelapp.com/psychology-principles-every-uiux-designer-needs-know/)

# 1. Fitts’s Law

[Fitts’s Law: The Importance of Size and Distance in UI Design | Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/fitts-s-law-the-importance-of-size-and-distance-in-ui-design)

The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

用户抵达目标的时间取决于距离以及目标大小

# 2. Hick’s Law

The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

做决定的速度取决于选择个数以及选项的复杂程度。 

# 3. Jakob’s Law

Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

用户会花大量时间在其他的网站上。 职责意味着用户在使用你的网站的时候期待的方式是和其他网站保持一致的。 

# 4.Law of Prägnanz

[Design Principles: Visual Perception And The Principles Of Gestalt — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/)

People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
对于模糊或是负责的的图片/图形， 我们会以简单的方式去理解。 


# 5. Law of Proximity 

Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

相近的元素更容易被视为是一组。 

# 6. Law of Similarity 

The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.

相似的元素更容易被视为是一副完整的图片，形状或是同一组，即便他们是分开的。 

# 7. Miller’s Law

The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
普通人的工作记忆做多只能记住7个左右的事项。 

# 8. Occam’s Razor

[Occam’s Razor: A Great Principle for Designers | Webdesigner Depot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/07/occams-razor-a-great-principle-for-designers/)

Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

用户倾向于选择更加简单明了的选项而不是那些不理解的选项。 

# 9. Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

对于大多数事情来说， 80%的效果来自20%的原因。 

# 10. Parkinson’s Law

Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.

时间有所限制的时候人们才会更快的采取行动

# 11. Serial Position Effect

[The Serial Position Effect: Why ABC and XYZ stand out the most among all the alphabets.](https://medium.com/coffee-and-junk/design-psychology-serial-position-effect-ca0e4cf299cb)

Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.

用户更倾向于记住列表中的第一项或最后一项。 

Experiments show that when participants are presented with a list of words, they tend to remember the first few and last few words, and are more likely to forget those in the middle of the list.

This is known as the serial position effect.

The tendency to recall earlier words in a list is called the Primacy Effect; and the tendency to recall the later words is called the Recency Effect.

## The Primacy Effect

The theory for the primacy effect is that the greater accuracy of recall is due to the relatively small amount of processing effort expended in rehearsing the item by itself.

This is in contrast to proceeding items (in the middle of a sequence) which must be rehearsed with all the other preceding information (in the beginning of a sequence); causing significant cognitive burden and affecting recall.

## The Recency Effect

The theory for the recency effect is that recall is better for items appearing towards the end of a sequence due to their preservation in our working memory (the part of our short-term memory that processes conscious and immediate perceptual information.) Our working memory holds temporary information and acts as a buffer for new information while it absorbs into other memory systems.

How can designers use Serial Position Effect?

Knowing that the positioning of an item can affect user experience by causing information in the middle of a sequence to be harder to recall, designers can make conscious choices while placing items in a list, or arrange content in a webpage.

Placing the least important items in the middle of lists can be helpful because these items tend to be stored less frequently in long-term and working memory.

If the user has to take a decision some time after exposure (> 30 seconds), then placing the most important items first in a list can be of advantage. And, if the user has to take a decision immediately after reading the list, then placing the most important item last on the list can be of advantage. 

E.g., on a sales pages consider placing the main benefit of your product on top of the list, and your persuasive extras like “free shipping” and “5% cashback”, last. This way if the subject leaves the page they are more likely to remember the main benefit of your product.

When the user doesn’t set the pace of the presented items, such as in video and audio, it is usually better to present the most important items last.

Designers should also be aware of the primacy and recency effects while conducting surveys, especially while having people choose from a long list, as they often represent a margin of error. The right way to conduct the survey is to shuffle the list positions for each vote so as to nullify the error.

# 12. Tesler’s Law

[Explaining the Law of Conservation of Complexity - Humanist](http://www.humanist.co/blog/law-of-conservation-of-complexity/)
[Larry Tesler Interview](http://www.designingforinteraction.com/tesler.html)
[Simplicity is Overrated - Marvel Blog](https://blog.marvelapp.com/simplicity-is-overrated/)

Tesler’s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.

Every application must have an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal with it.

Here is one way to estimate value or cost to users for a cost-benefit analysis. In this case, we will calculate the value or cost to users within a week. To do so, multiply the following together:

* Average frequency per week that a user encounters the complexity in question
* Number of active users per week
* Value/Cost, a unit representing what a single user will receive from the change or the cost incurred by users due to the complexity in question.

> The problem is that sometimes “simple” ends up treated as “minimal”, resulting on faulty features that don’t add much value to the user until the next iteration comes around, causing flaws on the user experience.

Here are a few things to consider when simplifying things:

* Aim for exceeding the expectations without overwhelming the experience.
* Try to reduce the time to perform a task. If that’s not possible, how can you make the waiting more tolerable?
* Provide clear and organized steps towards achieving the end result, ensuring that each state of your application fits properly into the flow.
* Reduce the amount of distractions
* Bring data forward in order to facilitate the process

# 13. Von Restorff Effect

The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

最与众不同的那个元素最容易被记住。 

# 14. Zeigarnik Effect

People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

人们倾向于记住那些尚未完成的或是中途被打扰的任务。
